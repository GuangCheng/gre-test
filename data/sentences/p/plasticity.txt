["Nothing better shows the ________ of her character than the ease with which she adapted herself to this sudden change.", "For De Maillet not only has a definite conception of the ________ of living things, and of the production of existing species by the modification of their predecessors, but he clearly apprehends the cardinal maxim of modern geological science, that the explanation of the structure of the globe is to be sought in the deductive application to geological phenomena of the principles established inductively by the study of the present course of nature.", "This ________ is, however, itself hereditary.", "Pure lead isa feebly lustrous bluishwhite metal, endowed with a characteristically high degree of softness and ________, and almost entirely devoid of elasticity.", "But their most characteristic, though not perhaps their most general, property is that they combine in themselves the apparently incompatible properties of elasticity and rigidity on the one hand and ________ on the other.", "Closely related to the structure of metals is their degree of \"________\" (susceptibility of being constrained into new forms without breach of continuity).", "What we have called ________ must not be confused with the notion of \"softness,\" which means the degree of facility with which the ", "Tresca show that the ________ of certain metals at least goes considerably farther than had before been supposed.", "To what extent such responses are transmitted to offspring, and what part they play in the formation of the adaptive characters that are conspicuous in many animals, remain dubious, but it is at least clear that natural selection can favour those individuals and those races which show the greatest power of responsive ________ in the individual.", "From the time of Pyrrho overlapping Aristotle himself, who seems to have been well content to use the feints of more than one school among his predecessors, while showing that none of them could claim to get past his guard, down through a period in which the decadent academy under Carneades, otherwise dogmatic in its negations, supplied new thrusts and parries, to Aenesidemus in the late Ciceronian age, and again to Sextus Empiricus, there seems to have been something of ________ and continuous progress.", "Clay can never become dry, ________ and ductility are, for reasons to be explained below, the first consideration, and there the proportion of grit should be lower.", "Processes of annealing, or very gradual cooling, are intended to relieve these strains, but such processes are only completely effective when the cooling, particularly through those ranges of temperature where the glass is just losing the last traces of ________, is extremely gradual, a rate measured in hours per degree Centigrade being required.", "The quality of ________ is developed to very different degrees in different metals, and even in the same species it depends on temperature, and may be modified by mechanical or physical operations.", "Most metals when molten are capable of dissolving at least small proportions of carbon, which, in general, leads to a deterioration in metallicity, except in the case of iron, which by the addition of small percentages of carbon gains in elasticity and tensile strength with little loss of ________ (see Iron).", "In many examples of apparent ________ it can be shown that this effect has been produced by an infinite number of minute slippings within the rock substance.", "In fact, even using the term ________ in papers on neuroscience was taboo.", "As the science improves, we could see other kinds of cognitive-modification drugs that boost recall, brain ________, even empathy and emotional intelligence.", "The authors studied the outer reaches of the field of \u201chuman performance modification\u201d \u2014 including brain-computer interfaces, neuro-pharmaceuticals, and \u201cbrain ________\u201d \u2014 in search of advances that may have military applications.", "Fortunately though, brain ________ studies have shown the brain can rewire itself into old age, and even add new cells in response to stimulation.", "Zachriel: Your previous claim of \"reduced morphological ________\" is not supported and you have been provided many examples of recent evolutionary change.", "Your previous claim of \"reduced morphological ________\" is not supported and you have been provided many examples of recent evolutionary change.", "Proteins can evolve new functions because they have inherent flexibility in ________ residues for future benefit, but I don't think you can get an IC system from accumulation of small random variations.", "Getting our brains to wire up properly requires experience during an early critical period of development, and understanding the mechanisms of this experience-dependent ________ is critical for understanding human development, its disorders, and for designing strategies that promote optimal cognitive development during early childhood, explained author and neuroscientist Gina Turrigiano.", "Its ________ is a danger as well as an advantage.", "From this the latter acquires a certain ________, it gives the body and its constituent parts the necessary stability and is ever ready."]
