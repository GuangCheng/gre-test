whether direct use is made of known parallaxes, or comparison is made with binaries of well-determined orbits of the same ________ type as the sun, in which therefore it may be assumed there is the same relation between mass and brilliancy (Gore), the result is found that the sun's magnitude is - 26.5, or the sun is Io n times as brilliant as a first magnitude star; it would follow that the sun viewed from a Centauri would appear as of magnitude 0.7, and from a star of average distance which has a parallax certainly less than o 1 \", it would be at least fainter than the fifth magnitude, or, say, upon the border-line for naked-eye visibility.", "We cannot here do more than refer to the ________ type of the sun.", "There ensued a general classification of the stars by Secchi into four leading types, distinguished by diversities of ________ pattern;
